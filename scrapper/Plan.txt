What the cron job will do:
	1) Check for time difference between last like timestamp and the time now and if it matches the frequency then do scrapping of the post with the user_provided_id.

	2) Threading of processes to scrap 3 times at the same time and should be 1 facebook and 2 twitter(to avoid facebook blocking)

	3) Reloading the check after every 1 minute(process 1)

	4) It should run for ever.

	5) It should run as a service on the machine as a deamon on boot.

Expected issues:
	1) Scheduling scrapping in 2 above in a way that after each 3 it will take the next 3 and continue.
